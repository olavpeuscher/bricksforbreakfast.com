                        Creating new music is what we do. In our believe, every jam-night can be the beginning of a new
                        track. Within our first album <em>One</em>, we just picked our loved tracks at the moment, to
                        share with you.
                        Our first album <em>Distraction</em>, is not just a selection of tracks, but some red line
                        between all tracks is going on.

                        Our current EP is <strong>One</strong>, where Distraction is our first official EP which will be
                        finished in December. <strong>Glutenfree Phylosophy</strong> is our killer track, released as a
                        single in October.</p>
                    <p>
                        At the moment, we are also exploring more electronic, 80s and R&B influences, which will be
                        found on our future releases.

                            Itâ€™s alive! We are proud to share with you the first single of our upcoming album Distraction, the killer track called <strong>Glutenfree Philosophy</strong>! The song is a critique on how we tend to focus so much on our online presence and acceptance, that we forget to stay in touch with our real selves and real-life social connections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Glutenfree Philosophy was recorded during a small holiday in <em>Friesland</em>.

                            Our first album, the very beginning of B4B. The first collection of tracks we wanted to
                            share with you. All tracks were recorded at an holiday home in <em>Germany</em>, with drums
                            in the kitchen, lots of gear, beers and cables everywhere.

                        Bricksforbreakfast is a Dutch recording collective formed in 2015, but foremost a group of
                        friends. Formerly playing in a coverband, where now this experience is put to use in producing
                        our Originals from our home studios and living rooms.
                    </p>

                    <p>Style-wise, we prefer to mix it up a little. From electronic to 60s rock and everything in
                        between. Trying to mix some old sounds and vintage gear with new electronic influences. Our aim
                        is to create every EP or album with its own vibe.</p>
