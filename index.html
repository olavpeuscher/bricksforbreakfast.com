            <p class="intro">
                Our first small album "just an ep" was recorded during a weekend trip in a bungalow park in Germany. The aim was to finalize some of our tracks to create the first album.

                <p>Bricks for Breakfast is a recording collective, but foremost a band of friends. Formally playing in a coverband, where now this experience is put to use in producing our Originals from our living rooms.
                    Style-wise, we prefer to mix it up a little. From electronic to 60s rock and everything in between. Every EP or album will have its own vibe.</p>
